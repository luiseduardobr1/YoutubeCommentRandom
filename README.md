# Requirements
* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

# How to use it
Just put video URL and decide the number of users that you want to select. 

OBS: If the code can't extract all comments, then try to increase **SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME** variable. Otherwise, if the code is too slow, just reduce the same variable.
